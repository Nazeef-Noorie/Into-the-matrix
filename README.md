# Into-the-matrix
This is basic C-code written just after an introductory C-course taken by me, the objective of the code is to carry out simple matrix athematic and transformations

Well i could tell you tiny snippets and details on how to use the code, but it is pretty obvious and I am pretty lazy :)
